 Hello guys and welcome to Python Programming Tutorials by Amulya's Academy. We were discussing about data structures in Python programming language. In the data structures we can have two categories that is built-in data structures and user-defined data structure. We were discussing about built-in data structures and in the previous tutorial we discussed about list and tuple. So today in this tutorial we will discuss about set and dictionary. So first let's talk about the dictionary. Key is defined using key-value pairs separated by comma enclosed within the curly braces. The key and value are separated by colon. So we can write this syntax of dictionary like this. We need a dictionary name followed by the curly brace and we have key and value pair. Key and value will be separated by colon and each key-value pair will be separated by the comma. So here keys in the dictionaries need to be unique and we can have only immutable objects as key. Values can be mutable or immutable but keys must be immutable objects. That is nothing but we can't have list as the key of a dictionary. Alright so let's see how to create the dictionary and how to use the dictionary. So to create the dictionary we can use the dictionary name followed by the curly braces. If I do this here we are creating an empty dictionary. So now if I check here we can see the is a dictionary and it doesn't contain any element that means it is a empty dictionary. Or if you want to create a dictionary with key and value pair you can take like this in the dictionary within the curly braces. I'll take key as string here. So I'll take name and here I'll take value as email address again a string value something like this. So now if I check the here we can see it contains key value pair and the key and values are separated by the colon and key and value pairs are separated by the comma. And also you can create the dictionary using dict constructor. So now the will be an empty dictionary. Okay in this way we can create the dictionary in Python. As I said in the dictionary keys are unique you can't have duplicate keys. For example if you have duplicate keys what will happen I'll show you that. So here I'll create my dictionary as dictionary equal to here I'll take j is equal to one and again I'll take key as j and here I'll take value as three right. So now if I see the dictionary here we can see j is three and k as two here we can't see the duplicate key that will be removed and three is assigned as the value for the key j keys in the dictionary need to be unique. And also as I said we can't use mutable objects as key. For example if I create a dictionary and in this if I use a list like this as the key we'll get error. So we can't use the mutable types as key values can be immutable type or mutable type that is okay but for key you need to use the immutable objects. You can use strings, tuple like that. Next dictionaries are unordered. Now if I check whether d is equal to d one yes it is true dictionary is not ordered. If you want to organize the data you can sort this manually but dictionaries are unordered. And next because dictionary is unordered you can't access the element from the dictionary using index. So you need to use the key to access the element from the dictionary. For example here we have a dictionary. So now if I want to access value one I need to use the and square brackets in that I need to mention the key. It will allow us to access the element. If you want to delete the elements also you need to access the value using the key like this right. And dictionaries are mutable so you can add or delete the element from the dictionary after creating that. For example if I have an empty dictionary now I can add the element to the dictionary using key. I need to write like this d and here I need to mention the key. For example if I take key as one and equal to I need to write the value. Now if I check here we can see and you can delete the element from the dictionary also. So dictionaries are mutable. This can be nested so you can use dictionary as the value of another dictionary. You can't use dictionary as the key of another dictionary because as we know key can't be mutable object right. But you can use a dictionary as the value for another dictionary. For example here I can take one equal to here I can take value as another dictionary. Like this. This is allowed. So this is about the dictionary. If you want a detailed explanation of the dictionary then you can go and watch my previous videos. The video link is in the description box. Alright so next we'll talk about the set data structure. So set is the collection of unique elements. So in set no item can be repeated. Set is the collection of unique elements. You can't have duplicate values in the set. And set can be defined using the curly braces. Yes both the set and dictionaries can be defined using the curly braces. But this syntax of both data structure is entirely different right. In the dictionary we have key value pair but in the set we don't have that. But this curly braces without any element denotes the empty dictionary. To create the empty set you need to use set constructor. So let's see how to create this set. So as I said if you want to create an empty set you need to use the set constructor. So here I will take yes equal to set and here we can see. Or you can create the set from this string. For example here I can take set or here I can take string. Okay or I can use. Alright like this. Or you can create using curly braces also for example like this. That is a set. If you are taking the curly braces and inside that if you are taking key value pair then that means that is the dictionary. In the curly braces if you are taking the elements then that is the set. Alright so next. As I said set is the collection of unique element. That is nothing but it doesn't contain any duplicate values. So what happens if I use the duplicate values. For example I will take like this and in the curly braces I will take values like this. And I will enter. Next I will see yes. Here we can see 1, 2, 3. It won't accept the duplicate values. Set is also unordered like dictionary set is also unordered. If I check s equal to s1 it is true. It is also unordered. Set is mutable. So after creating this set you can manipulate that. You can add elements or you can delete elements from the set. To add the element you can use add method. So for example you can take s dot add and here you can add the element. Still I get 1, 2, 3, 4 because trees already present so it won't take the duplicate values. But if I add here we can see. So set is mutable. Set can contain only immutable object as elements. Mutable types cannot be element of the set. So that is nothing but you can't have list as the element of set. Set can have only immutable object as elements. For example if I take like this we will get error. Set can contains only immutable type elements. So that's why set cannot be nested. We can't have set inside a set because set is mutable. It is a mutable object. So that's why we can't have set as the element of another set. So set can't be nested. For example if I have inside that I will have 1, 2. We'll get error. Set can have different types of element. But the type of element should be immutable objects. And you can perform the standard operation of this set which you use in the mathematics. Here also like union, intersection, difference etc. If you want to create a list of items where each element need to be unique then you can use the set data structure. And because set is unordered we can't access the element from set using the index. In the dictionary we have key value pair and using key we can access the value. But in the set we don't have key and value pair also. So to access the element from the key you can use the loops or you can check whether that element is present in the set or not using the in membership operator. For example here you can take one in yes. It will give true. Or you can take yes and you can print like this. So if you want detailed explanation on set you can refer my previous videos. I will give you the link of the videos in the description box you can go and check that. So that's it for now guys. Thank you for watching. Don't forget to subscribe to my channel. I will meet you in next class till then take care.
